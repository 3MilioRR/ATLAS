The web application consists of a React frontend, a Node.js backend with a RESTful API, a PostgreSQL database for structured data, and an S3-compatible file storage system for user uploads, with Redis used for caching. Data flows from the client to the backend via HTTPS, where it is processed, stored, or forwarded to integrated third-party APIs (e.g., payment gateways or analytics services), all secured with API keys and mutual TLS. Trust boundaries are defined by role-based access control (RBAC), with user roles (admin, editor, viewer) restricting access to sensitive data, while JWT tokens handle authentication and session management. The system processes personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, encrypted at rest and in transit, with OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
